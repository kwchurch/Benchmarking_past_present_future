<h1>Home Page for ACL-2021 Workshop on Benchmarking: Past, Present and Future (BPPF)</h1>

Where have we been, and where are we going?  It is easier to talk about the past than the future. These days,
benchmarks evolve more bottom up (such as <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">papers with code</a>). There used to
be more top-down leadership from government (and industry, in the  case of
systems, with benchmarks such as <a href="https://www.spec.org/benchmarks.html">SPEC</a>). Going forward, there may be more
top-down leadership from organizations like <a href="https://mlperf.org/"> MLPerf </a> and/or influencers like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrucci"> David Ferrucci </a>, who was responsible for IBM’s success with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P18EdAKuC1U">Jeopardy</a>, and
has recently written a paper suggesting how the community should think
about benchmarking for machine comprehension (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01525.pdf">To Test Machine Comprehension, Start by Defining Comprehension</a>). Tasks such as reading
comprehension become even more interesting as we move beyond English.
Multilinguality introduces many challenges, and even more opportunities.

We have an amazing collection of invited speakers that can share with
us first hand knowledge of how benchmarking became important in
Information Retrieval, and then in speech (starting around 1975), and
then in language (in 1988).  Much of this history is described
in <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/search/liberman/">this
video</a> and two 2016 Interspeech keynotes: Makhoul describes how
benchmarking overcame resistance in speech
in <a href="https://www.superlectures.com/interspeech2016/isca-medalist-for-leadership-and-extensive-contributions-to-speech-and-language-processing">this
keynote</a>, and Jurafsky describes how this approach moved from
speech to language
in <a href="https://www.superlectures.com/interspeech2016/ketchup-interdisciplinarity-and-the-spread-of-innovation-in-speech-and-language-processing">this
keynote</a>.

   <h2>Draft Schedule</h2>

All talks (invited and submitted) will be pre-recorded in advance, and posted by the end of July.

In addition, there will be 5 Q&A sessions via Zoom in a single
plenary session.  It is hoped that most speakers (and the
audience) will have seen the pre-recorded talks before the live
Zoom sessions, so the Zoom sessions will have more back and forth
discussion, and will not digress into individual talks.

<h4>Title: What Will it Take to Fix Benchmarking in Natural Language Understanding?</h4>

Evaluation for many natural language understanding (NLU) tasks is broken: Unreliable and biased systems score so highly on standard benchmarks that there is little room for researchers who develop better systems to demonstrate their improvements. The recent trend to abandon IID benchmarks in favor of adversarially-constructed, out-of-distribution test sets ensures that current models will perform poorly, but ultimately only obscures the abilities that we want our benchmarks to measure. In this position paper, we lay out four criteria that we argue NLU benchmarks should meet. We argue most current benchmarks fail at these criteria, and that adversarial data collection does not meaningfully address the causes of these failures. Instead, restoring a healthy evaluation ecosystem will require significant progress in the design of benchmark datasets, the reliability with which they are annotated, their size, and the ways they handle social bias.

<h4>Title: Context for Interpreting Benchmark Performances</h4>

Interpreting benchmark results requires a more nuanced study than
simply comparing a single number (e.g., accuracy). For example, higher
performance on benchmark focusing on multi-hop reasoning does not
translate to model architecture focusing on multi-hop reasoning but
often a bigger pretrained model. In the first half of the talk, I will
discuss the nuances of interpreting benchmark results, and our
previous efforts in integrating highly relevant axis, computational
resources, into evaluation. In the second half of the talk, I will
talk about the issues with the static benchmarks in the evolving
world. Unlike traditional benchmarks which mostly targeted linguistic
knowledge, modern benchmark embraces common sense, social context, and
encyclopedic world knowledge into the task definition. All these
components change over time, urging NLP benchmarks to be refreshed.

<h4>Title: Moving out of the comfort zones: desired shifts in NLP benchmarking</h4>
<p>
As the deep-learning era has transformed the NLP field, benchmarking
practices haven’t changed that much, often addressing earlier language
analysis tasks and applications. While performance on many benchmarks
rocketed, mostly in deep learning comfort zones, profound language
technology is still a long way ahead. In this talk, I will argue for
three desired interrelated shifts in NLP benchmarking, which motivate
and support each other, that should direct further research.
<p>
First, much more emphasis should be given to typical realistic
settings, in which large training data for the target task is not
available, like few-shot and transfer learning. Moreover, benchmarks
design should fit realistic data compositions, rather than synthetic
ones within the comfort zone, as I will illustrate by a recent
few-shot relation classification dataset. Second, recognizing the
limits of foreseeable fully-automated methods in addressing the hard
NLP challenges, I suggest developing principled evaluation
methodologies for various interactive NLP settings. Interaction may
lead to better results, with the help of a human in the loop, and
moreover allow personalized and explorative behavior, as I will
demonstrate with a recent framework for evaluating interactive
summarization. Lastly, while many current models operate in an
end-to-end manner over implicit language structures, I argue that it
is pertinent to pursue also explicit representations for textual
information structure, to facilitate refined and better-controlled
modeling. Unlike traditional semantic formalisms, I propose pursuing
semi-structured representations, consisting of natural language
expressions over which current powerful text-embeddings can be
applied. I will illustrate this direction by an approach for
decomposing the information in single and multiple texts into sets of
question-answer pairs, and draw some analogies from our successful
experience in designing the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE, later
aka NLI) task.

<h4> Title: Really Reaching Human Parity? –Addressing Benchmark Issues on Robustness, Bias and Metrics</h4>

We use Machine Reading Comprehension as an example to recap the
current status of NLP benchmarks and highlight four key issues with
the existing benchmarks including (1) lack of robustness testing on
the new independent (but similar) dataset or adversarial inputs, (2)
strong constraints on experimental conditions, (3) bias brought by
data sampling or human annotation, and (4) lack of suitable evaluation
metrics. Then we present our thoughts and experiments on the possible
solutions to these challenges from various aspects.

<h4>Title: Machine Understanding in Context</h4>

The ability for machines to read, understand and reason about natural
language would dramatically transform the knowledge economy across all
industries. Today’s latest Deep Learning marvels do not understand
what they read to the extent required for rational problem solving and
transparent decision making. And yet we need machines to read,
understand and engage with us at a rational level for us to take
responsibility for their predictions.  A potential problem slowing the
advancement of natural language understanding may be that we are not
ambitiously or rigorously defining what it means to comprehend
language in the first place. Current metrics and tests may be
insufficient to drive the right results. In this talk, I will present
a definition of comprehension and early experimental results that
strongly suggest existing systems are not up to the task. I will also
demonstrate a system architecture and behavior that reflects the sort
of language understanding capabilities we envision would do better to
advance the field of NLU.

<h4>Title: Rethinking Benchmarking in AI</h4>

The current benchmarking paradigm in AI has many issues: benchmarks saturate quickly, are susceptible to overfitting, contain exploitable annotator artifacts, have unclear or imperfect evaluation metrics, and do not necessarily measure what we really care about. I will talk about our work in trying to rethink the way we do benchmarking in AI, specifically in natural language processing, focusing mostly on the Dynabench platform.

<p>

Bio: Douwe Kiela is a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research, working on natural language processing and multimodal reasoning and understanding.

<h4>Title: The Dawn of Benchmarking</h4>

Benchmarking, or common evaluations, can be traced back to a speech recognition workshop in 1987 that pitted a knowledge- or rule-based method against an automatically trainable method on an evaluation task with a defined corpus.  The workshop was part of the DARPA Strategic Computing Program.  Deciding on an evaluation metric was a contentious issue that was settled soon after into the currently used word error rate.  Program managers at DARPA continued to champion the idea of metrics-based common evaluations with defined training and test corpora and, by inviting international research groups to participate in these annual common evaluations, this benchmarking paradigm took hold and spread to other DARPA programs and internationally.  DARPA also provided seed funding for the establishment of the Linguistic Data Consortium, which was instrumental in making common corpora available to the world at large.

<p>

<h4>Title: Benchmarking as a Method for Long-Term Research Management: The Common Task Method</h4>

Over the course of half a century, DARPA's Human Language Technology program created capabilities such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text understanding, turning them from science fiction fantasies to everyday practical fact. This sustained success was based on the development of the Common Task Method, which allowed decades of incremental progress in advance of commercial viability. I'll describe the origin and (sometimes counter-intuitive) progress of this method, distinguish it from other uses of benchmarking, and speculate about its future.
<p>

<h4>Title: Detection of Dementia from Speech Samples</h4>
<p>
Diagnosis or early detection of the onset of dementia is important
for interventions and planning for life-style changes.  Ideally, we
would like to achieve accurate diagnosis based on samples of
naturalistic language production, as well as samples ellicited using
some standard formats, such as narrative, script reading, or picture
description. Currently, research in this area relies primarily on the
Pitt Corpus in DementiaBank which includes cookie theft narratives
from 104 controls, 208 persons with dementia, and 85 persons with
unknown diagnosis. These data were used in the ADReSS challenge for
INTERSPEECH2020 and will be used in a new challenge for 2021.  The
previous challenge used hand-created transcripts.  The new challenge
focuses on a pipeline that can be applied automatically, using ASR and
NLP methods. The four major gaps in the current data set are: 1) we
need fuller ancillariy data on cognitive and medical status, 2) we
need longitudinal data on progression, 3) we need more data across
language task and interaction types, and 4) ideally, we would like to
have data recorded in the home with voice assistant technology.
Currently, challenge participants are committed to open sharing of
algorithms, but we need more sharing of primary language data,
including data outside of English.

<h4>Title: Lessons from SPEC</h4>
 

In the 1980s, amidst fierce competition among new microprocessor architectures, CPU benchmarking was in poor condition.
Many commonly-used benchmarks were  small synthetic benchmarks like Whetstone and Dhrystone that poorly-matched realistic programs.
Companies sometimes outright cheated by special-casing compilers to recognize major benchmarks.
Some vendors honestly reported results from realistic benchmarks, but even when running the same programs, often used different inputs,
so that potential customers could not easily make direct comparisons. Many customers did not trust performance claims.

<p> 
The talk reviews the odd way SPEC got started in 1988, initially by MIPS, Apollo, Hewlett-Packard and Sun, later joined by many others,
then covers the ground rules that evolved to let fierce competitors work together successfully to produce benchmarks that became industry standards and
exemplars of good methodologies for selecting benchmarks, validating results, reporting them carefully and deciding when they had to be retired as obsolete for one reason or another.

<p>
SPEC of course is still active, 30+ years later.
The talk reviews lessons learned about high-stakes benchmarking, evolution of benchmark suites over time, competitor social issues, credibility issues when people think the foxes are guarding the henhouse,
as we were asked by a member of the press.
From the beginning, SPEC reported performance on a set of benchmarks as a set of ratios versus a base system, so that people could find benchmarks they thought relevant to their own and ignore the others.
Many arguments had occurred over summary means, but as had been done in some performance reports, SPEC correctly used the Geometric Mean, but without really delving into the underlying statistics,
which only happened in 2004.

<p>
A set of benchmark ratios can be viewed as a sample (representative if selected by experts) from a large population of programs.
In practice, many sets of benchmark ratios are well-fit by the lognormal distribution, whose mean is the Geometric Mean, but also allows computation of a (Multiplicative) Standard Deviation, Confidence Intervals, etc.
The talk briefly reviews the relevant, simple statistics and the rationale for them.

<h4>Title: Benchmarking for diarization. Lessons from the DIHARD evaluation series</h4>


Recently, there has been renewed interest in speaker diarization --
that is, the task of determining “who spoke when” in a recording. With
this renewed interest has come major improvements in system
performance with error rates for the DIHARD challenge falling by 33%
in the span of 4 years. However, despite these successes, the goal of
truly robust diarization which is resilient to the full range of
natural variation in recordings (e.g., conversational domain,
recording equipment, reverberation, ambient noise) remains elusive. In
this talk we will review the evolution of the state-of-the-art on
multiple domains from the DIHARD dataset as well as some challenges we
have encountered in attempting to construct a representative
diarization benchmark.

<p>
Coopetitions are activities in which competitors cooperate for a common good. Community evaluations such as the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) are prototypical examples of coopetitions in information retrieval (IR) and have now been a part of the field for thirty years. This longevity and the proliferation of shared evaluation tasks suggest that, indeed, the net impact of community evaluations is positive.  But what are these benefits, and what are the attendant costs?

This talk will use TREC tracks as case studies to explore the benefits and disadvantages of different evaluation task designs. Coopetitions can improve state-of-the-art effectiveness for a retrieval task by establishing a research cohort and constructing the infrastructure---including problem definition, test collections, scoring metrics, and research methodology---necessary to make progress on the task. They can also facilitate technology transfer and amortize the infrastructure costs. The primary danger of coopetitions is for an entire research community to overfit to some peculiarity of the evaluation task. This risk can be minimized by building multiple test sets and regularly updating the evaluation task.]

<h4>Title: Benchmarks: An Industry Perspective</h4>

In recent years, the researchers from academia created large-scale
datasets mainly in a crowdsourcing way, that accelerate the
development of NLP technology. However, these datasets might present
different distributions and different challenges from the ones in
real-world applications. In this talk, we will introduce our efforts
on building NLP benchmarks from an industry perspective. Specifically,
we will describe our released datasets on the tasks including question
answering, dialogue and simultaneous translation that were created to
tackle with the problems in industrial applications. We will present
the challenges of these datasets and show how these datasets drive the
advancements of NLP technologies. Additionally, we will talk about
LUGE, which is an Open-Source Project of Chinese NLP benchmarks. LUGE
aims to evaluate NLP models in terms of robustness and adaptability
across multiple tasks and multiple domains, which are very crucial for
their success in industrial applications.
